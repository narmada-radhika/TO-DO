# TO-DO
This project is a Python-based To-Do List App using the Tkinter library for GUI development. This app allows users to add tasks to a list, display the tasks in a Listbox, and delete selected tasks. The tasks are saved to a text file (data.txt) for record-keeping. It was developed during my Internship.
